# Now Playing Release Date

![Preview image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Plueres/spicetify-extensions/main/now-playing-release-date/preview.jpg)
This extension adds a release date for the currently playing track next to the artist name(s)

> When quickly changing songs, it might duplicate the object, just go back one song and skip again.

It will create a new element in the now playing bar like this: ![Smaller preview image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Plueres/spicetify-extensions/main/now-playing-release-date/preview-small.jpg)

This object is clickable, once clicked it will bring up a menu where you can configure where the release date object can be placed, what format it should use and if you want to have a dot or a dash as the separator
